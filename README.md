# CS Build Week 1 for Data Science Students

# Naive Bayes Classifer Implementation

Criteria: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Data-Science-Build-Week-1


# Part I

Naive Bayes Classifier - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier

In this project the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm is implemented as a Python class and has the required methods `fit` and `predict`. Only base Python, `numpy`, and `scipy` are allowed to be used for the implementation of the core of this Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm. 


# Part II

For the second part of this Build Week project, there is also a HOW-TO blog entry that describes the algorithm, how to implement it and what it's useful for here:

The reader should be able to begin implementation of the algorithm based on the information presented.
